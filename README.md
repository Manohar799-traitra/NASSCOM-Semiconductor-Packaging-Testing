# 📦 Semiconductor Packaging & Testing Workshop Portfolio  
### *From Wafer to System — Theory, Manufacturing & ANSYS-Based Simulation*


## 📘 Repository Overview

This repository documents my complete learning journey through an advanced **Semiconductor Packaging & Testing Workshop**, covering the full post-silicon semiconductor lifecycle — from foundational packaging theory to assembly manufacturing, reliability qualification, and hands-on thermal simulation using **ANSYS Icepak**.

Modern semiconductor performance no longer scales only through transistor shrinking. Instead, it relies heavily on **advanced packaging architectures such as 2.5D and 3D integration**, heterogeneous chiplet design, and high-bandwidth memory stacking. This repository captures these concepts through structured modules and professional simulation labs.


## 🗓 MODULE 1  
# Packaging Evolution: From Basics to 3D Integration

### 📖 Introduction

Semiconductor packaging serves as the physical and functional bridge between microscopic silicon dies and macroscopic electronic systems. It provides environmental protection, electrical connectivity, mechanical stability, and thermal dissipation. Without packaging, fabricated silicon devices cannot survive real-world operating conditions.

As Moore’s Law scaling slows, modern computing platforms depend increasingly on advanced packaging to deliver higher performance, bandwidth, and power efficiency. Multi-die integration, chiplet architectures, and silicon interposers now define the performance of AI accelerators, GPUs, and high-end SoCs.
