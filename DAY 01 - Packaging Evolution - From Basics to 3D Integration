# 🗓 DAY 1  
# Packaging Evolution – From Basics to 3D & Chiplet Integration

---

## 📘 Introduction

Semiconductor packaging is the transformation layer that enables fragile nanometer-scale silicon dies to become mechanically robust, electrically accessible, and thermally stable electronic components. While wafer fabrication defines transistor performance, **packaging defines system-level reliability, power efficiency, signal integrity, and product lifespan.**

As transistor scaling slows, packaging has emerged as the dominant performance scaling engine. Modern processors now rely heavily on **advanced heterogeneous integration, chiplet architectures, and interposer-based designs** to achieve higher bandwidth, lower latency, and improved energy efficiency.
